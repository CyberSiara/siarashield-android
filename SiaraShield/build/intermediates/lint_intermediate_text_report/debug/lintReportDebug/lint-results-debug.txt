/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/build.gradle:12: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 35
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:13: Warning: Attribute usesCleartextTraffic is only used in API level 23 and higher (current min is 21) [UnusedAttribute]
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedAttribute":
   This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a
   version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with
   the minSdkVersion attribute).

   This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute.
   However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality
   of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to
   achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can
   optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be
   used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer
   attribute.

   Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags
   can be unused too, such as the new <tag> element in layouts introduced in
   API 21.

                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/java/com/cybersiara/app/CyberActivity.java:341: Warning: Use of scheduleAtFixedRate is strongly discouraged because it can lead to unexpected behavior when Android processes become cached (tasks may unexpectedly execute hundreds or thousands of times in quick succession when a process changes from cached to uncached); prefer using schedule [DiscouragedApi]
        T.scheduleAtFixedRate(new TimerTask() {
        ^

   Explanation for issues of type "DiscouragedApi":
   Discouraged APIs are allowed and are not deprecated, but they may be unfit
   for common use (e.g. due to slow performance or subtle behavior).

   Explanation for issues of type "HardwareIds":
   Using these device identifiers is not recommended other than for high value
   fraud prevention and advanced telephony use-cases. For advertising
   use-cases, use AdvertisingIdClient$Info#getId and for analytics, use
   InstanceId#getId.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/popup_layout.xml:123: Warning: Invalid layout param in a LinearLayout: layout_centerHorizontal [ObsoleteLayoutParam]
                    android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"/>
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteLayoutParam":
   The given layout_param is not defined for the given layout, meaning it has
   no effect. This usually happens when you change the parent layout or move
   view code around without updating the layout params. This will cause
   useless attribute processing at runtime, and is misleading for others
   reading the layout so the parameter should be removed.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/values/themes.xml:11: Warning: Unnecessary; SDK_INT is always >= 21 [ObsoleteSdkInt]
        <item name="android:statusBarColor" tools:targetApi="l">?attr/colorPrimaryVariant</item>
                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

    static Activity activity;
    ~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "StaticFieldLeak":
   A static field will leak contexts.

   Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class.
   If that outer class is for example a Fragment or Activity, then this
   reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a
   reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage
   collected.

   Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these
   longer running instances can cause leaks.

   ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/popup_layout.xml:228: Warning: This tag and its children can be replaced by one <TextView/> and a compound drawable [UseCompoundDrawables]
            <LinearLayout
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UseCompoundDrawables":
   A LinearLayout which contains an ImageView and a TextView can be more
   efficiently handled as a compound drawable (a single TextView, using the
   drawableTop, drawableLeft, drawableRight and/or drawableBottom attributes
   to draw one or more images adjacent to the text).

   If the two widgets are offset from each other with margins, this can be
   replaced with a drawablePadding attribute.

   There's a lint quickfix to perform this conversion in the Eclipse plugin.

        <LinearLayout
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DisableBaselineAlignment":
   When a LinearLayout is used to distribute the space proportionally between
   nested layouts, the baseline alignment property should be turned off to
   make the layout computation faster.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/activity_cybersiara.xml:45: Warning: Nested weights are bad for performance [NestedWeights]

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/activity_cybersiara.xml:181: Warning: Nested weights are bad for performance [NestedWeights]
                android:layout_weight="0.8"
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NestedWeights":
   Layout weights require a widget to be measured twice. When a LinearLayout
   with non-zero weights is nested inside another LinearLayout with non-zero
   weights, then the number of measurements increase exponentially.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/popup_layout.xml:37: Warning: This LinearLayout view is unnecessary (no children, no background, no id, no style) [UselessLeaf]

            <LinearLayout
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UselessLeaf":
   A layout that has no children or no background can often be removed (since
   it is invisible) for a flatter and more efficient layout hierarchy.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/popup_layout.xml:12: Warning: This LinearLayout layout or its LinearLayout parent is unnecessary [UselessParent]
    <LinearLayout
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UselessParent":
   A layout with children that has no siblings, is not a scrollview or a root
   layout, and does not have a background, can be removed and have its
   children moved directly into the parent for a flatter and more efficient
   layout hierarchy.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/values/strings.xml:10: Warning: Replace "..." with ellipsis character (…, &#8230;) ? [TypographyEllipsis]
    <string name="please_wait">Please Wait...</string>
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "TypographyEllipsis":
   You can replace the string "..." with a dedicated ellipsis character,
   ellipsis character (u2026, &#8230;). This can help make the text more
   readable.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher_round.xml:2: Warning: The application adaptive roundIcon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MonochromeLauncherIcon":
   If android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in your manifest, you must
   either remove the reference to android:roundIcon if it is not needed; or,
   supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the android:roundIcon
   and android:icon attribute.

   For example, if android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in the
   manifest, a launcher might choose to use android:roundIcon over
   android:icon to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed
   application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also
   specified in android:roundIcon.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/popup_layout.xml:167: Warning: This text field does not specify an inputType [TextFields]
                <EditText
                 ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "TextFields":
   Providing an inputType attribute on a text field improves usability because
   depending on the data to be input, optimized keyboards can be shown to the
   user (such as just digits and parentheses for a phone number). 

   The lint detector also looks at the id of the view, and if the id offers a
   hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the id contains the phrase
   phone or email), then lint will also ensure that the inputType contains the
   corresponding type attributes.

   If you really want to keep the text field generic, you can suppress this
   warning by setting inputType="text".

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/popup_layout.xml:167: Warning: Missing autofillHints attribute [Autofill]
                <EditText
                 ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Autofill":
   Specify an autofillHints attribute when targeting SDK version 26 or higher
   or explicitly specify that the view is not important for autofill. Your app
   can help an autofill service classify the data correctly by providing the
   meaning of each view that could be autofillable, such as views representing
   usernames, passwords, credit card fields, email addresses, etc.

   The hints can have any value, but it is recommended to use predefined
   values like 'username' for a username or 'creditCardNumber' for a credit
   card number. For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the
   AUTOFILL_HINT_ constants in the View reference at
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.

   You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an
   importantForAutofill attribute on that view or a parent view. See
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportant
   ForAutofill(int).

   Explanation for issues of type "ContentDescription":
   Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the
   contentDescription attribute to specify a textual description of the widget
   such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately
   describe the user interface.

   Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do
   not provide any content or enable a user action should not have
   accessibility content descriptions. In this case, set their descriptions to
   @null. If your app's minSdkVersion is 16 or higher, you can instead set
   these graphical elements' android:importantForAccessibility attributes to
   no.

   Note that for text fields, you should not set both the hint and the
   contentDescription attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set
   the hint.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/popup_layout.xml:167: Warning: Missing accessibility label: provide either a view with an android:labelFor that references this view or provide an android:hint [LabelFor]
                <EditText
                 ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "LabelFor":
   Editable text fields should provide an android:hint or, provided your
   minSdkVersion is at least 17, they may be referenced by a view with a
   android:labelFor attribute.

   When using android:labelFor, be sure to provide an android:text or an
   android:contentDescription.

   If your view is labeled but by a label in a different layout which includes
   this one, just suppress this warning from lint.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/popup_layout.xml:268: Warning: Hardcoded string "-", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
                    android:text="-"
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/spinner_text.xml:13: Warning: Hardcoded string "test", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
    android:text="test"/>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.

/Users/apple/siarashield-android/SiaraShield/src/main/res/layout/spinner_text.xml:10: Warning: When you define paddingLeft you should probably also define paddingRight for right-to-left symmetry [RtlSymmetry]
    android:paddingLeft="2dp"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RtlSymmetry":
   If you specify padding or margin on the left side of a layout, you should
   probably also specify padding on the right side (and vice versa) for
   right-to-left layout symmetry.

    android:paddingLeft="2dp"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RtlHardcoded":
   Using Gravity#LEFT and Gravity#RIGHT can lead to problems when a layout is
   rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use Gravity#START
   and Gravity#END instead. Similarly, in XML gravity and layout_gravity
   attributes, use start rather than left.

   For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and layout_marginLeft, use
   paddingStart and layout_marginStart. NOTE: If your minSdkVersion is less
   than 17, you should add both the older left/right attributes as well as the
   new start/end attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported
   and the start/end attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need
   the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which
   catches that type of error.

   (Note: For Gravity#LEFT and Gravity#START, you can use these constants even
   when targeting older platforms, because the start bitmask is a superset of
   the left bitmask. Therefore, you can use gravity="start" rather than
   gravity="left|start".)
